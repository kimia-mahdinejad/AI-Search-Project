# AI Search Project
This repository is designed to support the students of the Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals and Applications course by providing resources and structure code to implement various search strategies for the "Unblock Me" Android game using Python. The project focuses on both uninformed (BFS, DFS, and IDS) and informed (GBFS, A*, IDSA*) search strategies.

## Project Overview

In this repository, you will find the necessary resources, code, and guidance to work on implementing the following search strategies:

### Uninformed Search Strategies:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: A strategy that explores the shallowest nodes first.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: A strategy that explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.
- **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)**: A combination of BFS and DFS that increases the depth limit with each iteration.

### Informed Search Strategies:
- **Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)**: A strategy that prioritizes nodes based on a heuristic to reach the goal quickly.
- **A* Search**: A strategy that combines the cost to reach the node and a heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal, aiming for the optimal path.
- **Iterative-Deepening A* (IDSA*)**: A hybrid strategy that combines the depth-bound properties of IDS with the efficiency of A* search.

## Project Structure

The project structure code provided in this repository serves as a foundation for your implementation. It offers a structured framework, input/output handling, and game representation. You will build upon this structure to integrate the various search strategies into the "Unblock Me" game.

## Getting Started

To get started with your implementation, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local development environment.

2. Review the provided code structure to familiarize yourself with the foundation.

3. Begin implementing the search strategies using Python, adhering to the principles of uninformed and informed search.

4. Leverage the "Unblock Me" game representation in your code to apply the search strategies effectively.

5. Test and refine your implementations to ensure they work seamlessly with the game.
